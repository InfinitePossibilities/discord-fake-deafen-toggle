# Discord Fake Deafen / Mute
This script allows you to toggle on/off fake deafen/mute in voice chat

# How to use
<b>Ctrl + Shift + I</b> and go to "Console" tab. <br />
Paste in code from code.js and execute/press enter <br />
Press and release the Right Alt key to toggle on/off. <br /> 
You should hear yourself deafen and undeafen quickly. This is good. <br />

You'll now be able to talk normally, while others will see you as muted and/or deafened. Toggle off to fix any Discord issues that "require" relaunch of Discord.
